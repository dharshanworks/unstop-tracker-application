# unstop-tracker-application

The Unstop Tracker Application is a simple, front-end web-based dashboard designed to help users manage and track their progress in online competitions or subscription-based platformsâ€”most likely tailored for use with Unstop (formerly Dare2Compete). The interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on user interactivity, clean visuals, and minimal dependencies.

It likely supports features such as:

Visual tracking of participation status

Subscription or contest management

A dashboard layout inspired by modern SaaS UI
